# MachineLearning
The project is a deepening and operation testing of the "Q-Learning" algorithm.  We'll see as an agent placed in an unknown environment, it learns from his mistakes to arrive at the solution or in this case at the  exit of the labyrinth.
"Q-learning" is one of the most popular algorithms of reinforcement learning. 
One of his majors highlights are the ability to compare expected utility of available actions without request an environmental model.
