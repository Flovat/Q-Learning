# Q-learning
The project is a deepening and operation testing of the "Q-Learning" algorithm.  
We'll see as an agent placed in an unknown environment, it learns from his mistakes to arrive at the solution or in this case at the  exit of the labyrinth.

"Q-learning" is one of the most popular algorithms of reinforcement learning. 
One of his majors highlights are the ability to compare expected utility of available actions without request an environmental model.

Its goal is to allow an automatic learning system to adapt to the environment that surrounds it, improving the choice of actions to be performed. The model of the problem can be described by an agent, a set of states S and a set of action by state A. Performing an action the agent moves from one state to another state. Each state provides the agent with a reward (a real or natural number). The agent's goal is to maximize the total reward. The agent does this by learning what are the optimal actions associated with each state.
